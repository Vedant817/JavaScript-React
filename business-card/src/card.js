                            Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define
                            paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least
                            five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality,
                            though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what
                            constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of
                            sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and
                            Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a
                            section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of
                            writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just
                            one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of
                            sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer
                            to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens
                            in the rest of the paragraph.
